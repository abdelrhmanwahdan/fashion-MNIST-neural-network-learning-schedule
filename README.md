# fashion MNIST neural network learning schedules
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the Fashion MNIST data set then after that I am doing classification on it using convolutional neural network (CNN) by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. using different Learning Rate Scheduling techniques to improve optimizers:
    - Power Scheduling
    - Exponential Scheduling
    - Piecewise Constant Scheduling
    - Performance Scheduling
    - tf.keras schedulers
    - 1Cycle scheduling
